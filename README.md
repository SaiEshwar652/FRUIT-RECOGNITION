# FRUIT-RECOGNITION
Created a machine learning model to detect the type of fruit and its accuracy by  importing the image of the fruit by using Convolutional Neural Networks .

# Fruits 360

A dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables

# Dataset properties

Total number of images: 82213.
Training set size: 61488 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).
Test set size: 20622 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).
Multi-fruits set size: 103 images (more than one fruit (or fruit class) per image)
Number of classes: 120 (fruits and vegetables).
Image size: 100x100 pixels.
The Dataset Can be found over :  and https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset

This is the work of Horea Muresan, Mihai Oltean, Fruit recognition from images using deep learning, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Informatica Vol. 10, Issue 1, pp. 26-42, 2018.

The paper introduces the dataset and an implementation of a Neural Network trained to recognized the fruits in the dataset.
